// and does not return a value. The C function is invoked on the system stack,
// but no attempt is made to play nice with the Go scheduler or GC, so care
// must be taken. Do not use unless you know what you are doing.

// UnsafeCall4 allows calling a C function taking 4 uintptr arguments from Go.
